The order to run the file are as follows:

Open MySQL Command Line Client
Log in and run the following 
	source <path to bacchus.init.sql>
	You may need to do two \\ instead of \ in your path

Open bacchus_create.py and run it
	Ensure that line 42 has the proper path to bacchus_table_create.sql
	You may need to do two \\ instead of \ in your path

Finally run bacchus_populate.py
	Comment out the table population functions at the bottom after first run to avoid duplicating table data

Uncomment and run the print table functions as needed
